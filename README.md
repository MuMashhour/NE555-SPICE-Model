# NE555-SPICE-Model
Welcome to the NE555 Timer Spice Model repository! This project contains a Spice model for the popular NE555 timer IC, which is widely used in electronic circuits for generating accurate time delays or oscillations.

### What is a Spice Model?
A Spice model is a mathematical depiction of an actual electronic part, like an integrated circuit, resistor, or capacitor. It gives details about the electrical properties of the component, including its capacitance, resistance, and current-voltage behaviour. Engineers can simulate the behaviour of electronic circuits that contain the represented components using spice models.

### Why?
With the NE555 circuit, there are already pre-built Spice models available, however building a new model from start can provide you a better grasp of how Spice models operate and are made. This project intends to uncover the strengths and limitations of alternative modelling approaches and to provide insights on increasing the accuracy of Spice models by carefully examining and comparing the findings of this new model with those of current models.

I urge you to investigate each element of this model, comprehend how it works, play around with it, and try to improve it. You can learn more about the operation of Spice models and how they might be enhanced by doing this.

### Usage
Open the [NE555 sch.asc](../NE555 sch.asc) file using your preferred spice programme after downloading. (ex. LTSpice). All but the reset pin are included and labeled in the model. Connect the circuit like you would any other circuit and start simulating! and example astable implementation can be found in the repo under [Astable Example.asc](Astable Example.asc).

### Contributing
If you find any issues with the NE555 Spice model, or if you have suggestions for improvements or new features, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Contributions are welcome and appreciated!
